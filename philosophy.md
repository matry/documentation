Matry is an attempt to "bridge the gap", so to speak, between designers and developers. Many such attempts currently exist, and more are being introduced with each passing day. We think our approach is unique. In the following document, we will outline that approach, and hopefully shed some light on the logic underpinning Matrys design decisions.

## The State of The Industry

Before delving into our solution, it would be helpful to first explore the current landscape with respect to this effort. Because while there are many contemporary discussions around this issue, nearly all of them suffer from a few problems.

The first problem is that the discussion is heavily focused on the web. Consequently most tooling dedicated to solving this problem focuses on CSS and Javascript, and even worse, usually only React (at the time of this writing). When other platforms are mentioned, they are typically iOS and Android. All three of these platforms are important, but they are not the only platforms in existence. Should designers be forced to change their tooling if they suddenly need to design for a TV or Windows application? We feel strongly that you shouldn't.

Another issue is the shallow thinking around the question of whether designers should learn to code. Most conversations and thoughts we've seen on this topic tend to fall into a categorical trap, which is the idea that designers are "creative" and developers are "technical". Usually these sentiments carry with them the implict conclusion that since code is "technical" and not "creative", then designers should steer clear. On the opposing end of this line of thought exists an equally dubious claim - that the category itself has no merit and that perhaps it should be discarded entirely. Unfortunately, egos inevitably get involved and people are made to feel as if their profession is being diluted or devalued.

The truth, as usual, lies somewhere in between these two extremes. That being said, there is one unequivocal truth that needs to be asserted - this question is not one of competence, ability, or intelligence. Instead of relying on poorly construed questions like whether designers "can" code, the question should be - what is the appropriate *interface* between designers and developers? In other words, where is the boundary between these two domains, and how might we form a coalition between our respective domains that maps to this boundary?
