Matry is an attempt to "bridge the gap", so to speak, between designers and developers. Many such attempts currently exist, and more are being introduced with each passing day. We think our approach is unique. In the following document, we will outline that approach, and hopefully shed some light on the logic underpinning Matrys design decisions.

Contemporary discussions around this issue suffer from a few problems. The first is that the discussion is heavily focused on the web. Consequently most tooling dedicated to solving this problem focuses on CSS and Javascript, and even worse, usually only React (at the time of this writing). When other platforms are mentioned, they are typically iOS and Android. All three of these platforms are important, but they are not the only platforms in existence. Should designers be forced to change their tooling if they suddenly need to design for a TV or Windows application? Ideally not.
