# What is Matry?

Matry is a platform-agnostic language built specifically for UI designers.

By using Design terminology and mental models, it carves out a space for designers to collaborate more closely with developers.

Matry takes inspiration from several technologies and ideas that have evolved the web over the past few decades.
This includes CSS, Atomic Design, Design Tokens, React, Tailwind, and many others.
