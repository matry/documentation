# Why Matry?

I'd like to keep this short and simple, and my favorite way to do this is with a list.
I built Matry because...

1. **Code is awesome**  
  a. In many cases (though not all) writing is faster and more flexible than drawing  
  b. But coding languages aren't currently built for designers  
  c. The closest is CSS but it's only for the web and has a lot of legacy cruft  

2. **We want a language that**  
  a. Is platform-agnostic but can be adapted for specific platforms  
  b. Uses Design terminology and mental models  
  c. Doesn't rely too heavily on conventions from the engineering world  

3. **So that we can**  
  a. Bridge the gap between design and development  
  b. Have an open-source language layer that can be used freely across several tools
